I embarked on this project to self-learn and enhance my front-end and back-end software development skills. The project aims to develop a carpooling management system designed for recurring usage by larger groups, such as sports clubs, streamlining transportation logistics. Specifically, it was made to learn **Typescript, React, Redux Toolkit, RESTful API, and MySQL.** I also used Next.js, Auth0 for authentication, Kysely for typesafe query building, and Mantine to create a passable user interface. The backend is largely done but the front-end is incomplete and not pretty. I am currently not able to do the project, but I may return to finish it in the future.
