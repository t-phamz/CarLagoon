Motivated by a strong intellectual curiosity and a desire to continuously challenge myself, I undertook this project to deepen my expertise in both front-end and back-end software development. The goal of the project is to create an efficient and user-friendly carpooling management system tailored for recurring use by larger groups, such as sports clubs. This system aims to streamline transportation logistics, providing a seamless solution for organizing and managing carpool schedules, enhancing convenience, and promoting sustainable travel practices within communities. Specifically, it was made to learn **Typescript, React, Redux Toolkit, RESTful API, and MySQL.** I also used **Next.js**, **Auth0** for authentication, **Kysely** for typesafe query building, and **Mantine** to create a user interface. I am currently not able to do the project, but I may return to finish it in the future to finish the frontend as the backend is mostly finished.
